            <img src="images/family.jpg" alt="Jimmy Farrelly's Family" class="family-pic">
            <p>Above is a photo of my family, including my parents, Michele and Jim, and my two sisters, Grace and Mary.</p>
            <p>I am a Senior at the University of Iowa, majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems, with a minor in Political Science. My 3.92 GPA reflects my commitment to my studies, balanced with three summer internships, extracurricular involvement, and on-campus employment. Professionally, as an Instructional Technology Assistant at UIowa and with prior internships in Real Estate Valuation and Healthcare Consulting, I've developed an ability to translate complex technical and analytical concepts into actionable solutions. Academically, my specialized analytics coursework, alongside core business courses in economics, marketing, accounting, and finance, has been crucial for developing a deep understanding of business fundamentals and analysis. My leadership experience, gained through executive roles in the Tippie Business Honor Society, Sigma Phi Epsilon, and the Interfraternity Council, has further refined my abilities in team management and strategic planning.</p>
