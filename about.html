            <p>Originally from Tinley Park, IL, I've embraced my time at the University of Iowa, pursuing a degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems. Balancing academics with real-world experiences, I've completed three internships and worked part-time as a student instructional technology assistant. This role has allowed me to support and enhance the university's learning environment, a challenge I relish.</p>
